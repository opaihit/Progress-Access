moderate pleomorphism is present nuclei are severely crowded together there is marked disorganization and lack of cellular polarity toward the surface urothelium mitosis is frequent throughout the tissue nucleoli are prominent and irregular high grade
nuclear features show moderate pleomorphism the nuclei are crowded to a severe degree architecturally the cells show complete lack of polarity toward the surface urothelium mitosis is frequent nucleoli is prominent high grade
nuclear features show moderate pleomorphism the nuclei are crowded to a severe degree architecturally the cells show complete lack of polarity toward the surface urothelium there are frequent mitotic figures throughout the tissue nucleoli is prominent high grade
moderate pleomorphism is present nuclei are mildly crowded together polarity is completely lost there are frequent mitotic figures throughout the tissue nucleoli is absent to inconspicuous high grade
minimal variability in nuclear size, shape, and outline consistent with moderate pleomorphism mild crowding of the nuclei can be seen polarity is completely lost mitosis is frequent throughout the tissue nucleoli is absent to inconspicuous high grade
moderate pleomorphism and cytologic atypia is present there is a mild degree of crowding there is marked disorganization and lack of cellular polarity toward the surface urothelium mitosis is frequent throughout the tissue the nuclei have inconspicuous nucleoli high grade
moderate pleomorphism is present there is a mild degree of crowding polarity is completely lost mitosis is frequent nucleoli is absent to inconspicuous high grade
moderate pleomorphism is present the nuclei are crowded to a mild degree architecturally the cells show complete lack of polarity toward the surface urothelium mitosis is frequent throughout the tissue visible and prominent nucleoli are not observed or exceedingly rare high grade
mild pleomorphism is present moderate nuclear crowding is seen there is no full-thickness lack of polarity observed mitosis is infrequent nucleoli is prominent high grade
mild pleomorphism and cytologic atypia is present moderate nuclear crowding is seen the lower half of the urothelium shows some degree of loss of polarity but the cells keep the organization as they mature toward the surface mitotic figures are infrequent and limited to the lower half of the urothelium nucleoli is prominent high grade
mild pleomorphism and cytologic atypia is present moderate crowding of the nuclei can be seen architecturally no overt lack of polarity is observed mitosis is infrequent the nucleoli of nuclei are prominent high grade
nuclear features show mild pleomorphism there is a moderate degree of crowding architecturally no overt lack of polarity is observed mitosis is infrequent prominent nucleoli are easily identified in low magnification scanning high grade
